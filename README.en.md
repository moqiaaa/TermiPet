TermiPet is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that keeps a pixel pet beside your terminal. It helps you **view terminal and AI agent status**, **send frequent commands**, **check Claude Code / Codex / GitHub Copilot usage**, and **chat with your pet** through local or online models.

It is not just decoration. TermiPet is a small workflow surface: quiet by default, but ready to open command shortcuts, status cards, usage panels, timers, and chat when you need them.

## Interface Preview

### Status Cards and Permission Prompts

TermiPet turns Claude Code and terminal activity into floating status cards. Cards can show the project, action, working directory, Hook source, and Allow / Deny prompts for commands that need your approval.

</p>

### Command Panel

The command panel keeps frequent Claude Code commands close at hand, including `/compact`, `/review`, `/status`, and `/diff`. You can insert commands into the current terminal, add your own entries, reorder them, and pin favorites.

### Switchable Pets

TermiPet includes multiple pets. `Terminal Cat` is the default mascot, and each pet can react with idle, thinking, running, reminder, error, sleep, and celebration animations.

</p>

### Pet Chat

Open chat from the floating toolbar and talk to the current pet directly. The pet can explain status, keep you company while coding, or respond with different personality presets. Chat can use local Ollama or online API providers.

### Floating Toolbar and Usage Card

Hover near the pet to open shortcuts for commands, folders, chat, skins, and Pomodoro. The usage card can show lightweight quota status for Claude Code, Codex, and GitHub Copilot.

## Privacy and Data

TermiPet runs locally on your Mac and **does not provide its own cloud relay server**. Configuration, keys, and local status stay on your machine unless you explicitly configure an external model or service endpoint.

| Data | How it is stored or used |
| --- | --- |
| Online model API keys | **Stored in macOS Keychain** and never uploaded to a TermiPet server. |
| Model Base URL and model name | Stored locally in Application Support to decide which endpoint to request. |
| Local Ollama chat | Sent to the local Ollama service on your Mac. |
| OpenAI / Gemini / custom API chat | Sent only to the provider endpoint you configured. TermiPet does not proxy requests. |
| Claude Code / Codex usage reading | Uses local credentials or local config to request official endpoints directly from your Mac. |
| Claude Code Hook status | Sent only to TermiPet's local `127.0.0.1` service for updating pet state. |
| Terminal preview and quick input | Uses macOS Accessibility permission locally to identify windows and input commands. |

In short: TermiPet is a **local plugin and desktop assistant**. API requests go to the address you configure; keys and workflow state are not uploaded to a TermiPet-owned server.

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| OS | macOS 14.0 or later |
| Build toolchain | Swift 6 |
| Local chat | Optional, requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) |
| Online models | Optional, requires OpenAI, Google Gemini, or compatible API credentials |
| Permissions | Terminal preview and quick input require macOS Accessibility permission |

## Download and Install

Most users can download the packaged macOS app without building from source:

1. Open [TermiPet Releases](https://github.com/bleeeet/TermiPet/releases).
2. Download `TermiPet-v0.1-macOS.zip` from the latest release.
3. Unzip it to get `TermiPet.app`.
4. Move `TermiPet.app` to Applications, or double-click it directly.
5. If macOS blocks the first launch, open System Settings -> Privacy & Security and allow TermiPet to run.

TermiPet appears in the macOS menu bar and does not show in the Dock by default. Terminal preview, quick command input, and folder `cd` input require macOS Accessibility permission.

## Build from Source

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/bleeeet/TermiPet.git
cd TermiPet
zsh Scripts/build-plugin.sh
```

The script runs tests, builds the app, copies resources and pet packages into `App/TermiPet.app`, signs the local build, and launches it.

## Usage

Start TermiPet from the menu bar, show the pet, and grant Accessibility permission if you want terminal preview and quick input. Hover near the pet to open the toolbar, send commands, open the chat panel, switch skins, or start Pomodoro.

Claude Code Hook can be installed from the menu bar. It writes local Hook files under `~/.claude/` and sends events to TermiPet's local service on `127.0.0.1`.

## Pet Chat Models

TermiPet supports local Ollama models such as Qwen2.5, Phi-3.5 mini, and Gemma 3 1B. Online mode supports OpenAI, Google Gemini, and custom OpenAI-compatible APIs. API keys are saved in macOS Keychain.

</p>

## Custom Pets

A pet package is a folder with at least:

```text
pet.json
spritesheet.webp
```

Imported pets are copied into TermiPet's Application Support directory. The app is compatible with Codex-style pet packages.

## Acknowledgements

TermiPet is shaped by and built around practical workflows involving **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Google Gemini**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Ollama**. They are not official contributors to or endorsers of TermiPet, but the app integrates with related local workflows, status displays, usage reading, and pet chat experiences.
